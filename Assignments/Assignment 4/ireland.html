        <h2> Dublin, Ireland</h2>
        <p>
            As someone who has strong Irish heritage, Ireland is the biggest dream vacation. Dublin is the most famous of those towns, and the place I want to visit most. The culture, the food, and the alcohol ofcourse!
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to hit up all the historic places in Dublin, as well as, the little hole in the wall pubs. Get the full experience. I cannot wait to visit Dublin!!

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <p>
            Here are some fun facts I found about Ireland. The first potato ever planted was planted in Ireland. Halloweens origins are from Ireland. There is a festival where a wild goat is caught and made king for three days.
